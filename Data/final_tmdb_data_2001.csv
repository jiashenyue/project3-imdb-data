With no where else to turn, Sven asks Falk to help him deal with the crazed Lehmann; Falk agrees, but soon realizes he's dealing with a more dangerous man than he imagined when Lehmann kidnaps Falk's wife Jeanette, and then releases her with a time bomb locked around her neck, demanding that Falk hand over ownership of his detective agency to Lehmann.",2.339,/8vS6T2XkXDuYqpyKec2lz2Jocw9.jpg,"[{'id': 2801, 'logo_path': '/bswb1PLLsKDUXMLgy42bZtCtIde.png', 'name': 'Film i Väst', 'origin_country': 'SE'}, {'id': 57354, 'logo_path': '/8CrMUkfg01tmrNbWxq0s6v0Dg6m.png', 'name': 'TV3 Sverige', 'origin_country': 'SE'}, {'id': 1929, 'logo_path': None, 'name': 'Sonet Film', 'origin_country': 'SE'}, {'id': 447, 'logo_path': None, 'name': 'TV 1000 Sverige', 'origin_country': 'SE'}]","[{'iso_3166_1': 'SE', 'name': 'Sweden'}]",2001-08-17,0.0,112.0,"[{'english_name': 'English', 'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}, {'english_name': 'Estonian', 'iso_639_1': 'et', 'name': 'Eesti'}, {'english_name': 'Swedish', 'iso_639_1': 'sv', 'name': 'svenska'}, {'english_name': 'German', 'iso_639_1': 'de', 'name': 'Deutsch'}]",Released,,Executive Protection,0.0,6.1,40.0,

Though most figured she would end up as a prostitute, she is married off to Isidro, the local police chief. Cruel and petty, this ogre of a man brutalizes her and eventually infects her with venereal disease, rendering her sterile. With the help of Melquíades, Otilia takes a series of lovers to spite her husband. One day, the wounded Ruben -- a wanted outlaw -- staggers onto her doorstep and immediately she is in love.
